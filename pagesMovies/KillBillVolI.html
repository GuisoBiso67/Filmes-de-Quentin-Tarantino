            <p class="paragraphMain">The film was to be released as a single feature, but it was divided into 2 parts for mere aesthetics and marketing, and at the time, hardly anyone would go to the cinema to see a movie of almost 5 hours. But the director considers it as a single film.</p>

            <p class="paragraphMain">It was considered one of the most violent movies of all time. But it's not violence used to shock, but to tell a story, which is very well written. In this first part, the action stands out a lot and is very well choreographed and well directed. The acting is very good, the characters are well built and the soundtrack is amazing. Despite understanding violence, it goes a little overboard at times. The movie is available on HBO Max and Paramount Plus.</p>
