            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>The book it is based on is called Rum Punch and the director has altered a bit of the plot and characters for his movie. It is Tarantino's film that was less acclaimed by the public, as it has fewer characteristics of the director himself, so much so that all the other scripts of his career were written by himself. I don't like it so much because its construction is very slow, but it presents good performances and a great direction. Its great highlight is certainly its soundtrack that borders on perfection and has great songs very well embedded in the film. The movie is available on GloboPlay.</p>
