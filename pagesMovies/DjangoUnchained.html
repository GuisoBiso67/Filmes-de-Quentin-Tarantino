            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Released in 2012, it was the director's first Wild West. Here, Christoph Waltz returns to play another great character: Dr. King Schultz and again won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The highlights of the film are the acid humor, the two types of violence, the peculiar soundtrack (there is the presence of rap in the middle of the shooting) and the dinner scene, which is phenomenal. It's about 30 minutes of dialogue so well done; it leaves you stuck in your chair. And a curiosity in this same scene is that Leonardo diCaprio broke a glass with his hands and cut himself, but continued acting. For me, it's a very well-developed story, with great performances and very well directed. The only flaw I see are some actions by Django, which made me like the character less, as they are similar to colonizer actions. The movie is available on HBO Max.</p>
