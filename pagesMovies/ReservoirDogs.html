            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Released in 1992, this was the director's first film and was made for just $1.2 million. Something interesting in this production is that the robbery scene is not shown and that the entire film is almost always in the same location. For me, the best scene is the first one, where the gang is talking about various random topics, from a Madonna song to a tipping argument. The soundtrack is also a strong point of the production: they are great songs and very well reconciled with the story. Unfortunately, for me, the script loses strength when it starts to tell about the past of some characters, even if they delve deeper into the story. The movie is available on HBO Max, Paramount Plus, GloboPlay and Starz.</p>
