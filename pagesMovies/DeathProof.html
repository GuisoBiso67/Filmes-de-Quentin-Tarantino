            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>It is Tarantino's strangest film, as it has screen failures, has a sequence that starts in black and white and is much slower than the others. It features a lot of dialogue, some interesting, others not so much. It manages to develop the protagonists well with these dialogues, but the story is a little shallow. The last 20 minutes of the movie are extremely exciting because it features a very well directed car chase, fast and furious level, and with an ending that mixes satisfaction and comedy. The movie is available on Globoplay.</p>
