            <p>It tells the story of Beatrix Kiddo, a pregnant woman who is shot in the head at her wedding and is left in a coma for 4 years. After waking up, she goes after the members of the group that killed everyone at her wedding.</p>

            <h2>Curiosity</h2>
            <p>The film was to be released as a single feature, but it was divided into 2 parts for mere aesthetics and marketing, and at the time, hardly anyone would go to the cinema to see a movie of almost 5 hours. But the director considers it as a single film.</p>

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>It's a very different movie from the first because it has more dialogue than action, but they are very interesting, well written and engaging. It has iconic scenes like training with Pai Mei and the scene where the protagonist comes out of a buried coffin. The highlight is the finale, which, despite not being a gigantic battle like the first, has one of the best dialogues in cinema involving Superman. It has its dull parts, but I think the second movie is better than the first. Both movies are available on HBO Max. The movie is available on HBO Max and Paramount Plus.</p>
