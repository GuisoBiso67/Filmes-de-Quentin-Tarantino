            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Released in 2009, the director spent a decade writing the script and it was the first time he felt comfortable changing a historical fact. It was a box office success and garnered several award nominations around the world. Something interesting is that the film is divided into 5 chapters, the main characters never meet and 4 different languages are spoken during the film: 40% English, 60% French and German and a little Italian. Here, Tarantino managed to build his best character: Hans Landa, who was brilliantly played by Christoph Waltz and won several awards for best supporting actor. Again, the film has many surprises and an amazing ending, as well as memorable scenes with great dialogue, such as the card game at the bar and the meeting between Shoshanna and Hans Landa. The movie is available on Prime Video, Star Plus and GloboPlay.</p>
