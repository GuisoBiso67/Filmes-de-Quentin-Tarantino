            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>The film's script was leaked in early 2014, before filming had even begun, and Tarantino dropped out of the project. In early 2015, after changing the ending, he returned and at the end of the same year he released The Hateful Eight in 70mm. Like Reservoir Dogs, the film takes place almost entirely in the same location: inside a cabin. There is no hero in the film, as all the characters are hateful (hence the name), but they are all very interesting, especially Daisy Domergue, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh, who draws attention when she says anything. thing (and was nominated for best supporting actress at the 2016 Oscars). Although it has some action, especially in the last hour, it is a film built only by dialogues that generate enormous tension from beginning to end and that ends in a wonderful and unexpected way. It was the director's first film to have an original soundtrack, composed by Ennio Morricone and which won an Oscar in 2016. The movie is available on HBO Max and Prime Video.</p>
