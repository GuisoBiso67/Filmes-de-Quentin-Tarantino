            <h2 class="titleMain" id="tirarEspaco">Review</h2>
            <p class="paragraphMain">Released in 1994, it was one of the director's most acclaimed films, both by critics and audiences and consider one of the best movies of all the times. Its main characteristics are the non-linear script, the dialogues and the breaking of expectations. Again, the soundtrack stands out in several scenes. All the actors were nominated at the 1995 Academy Awards (the Oscar), but won only for Best Original Screenplay. The performances are very good, but Bruce Willis, despite his part in the story being very interesting in the film, he doesn't have a high load of expressiveness like the others, which for me is the only down point. The movie is available on HBO Max and Paramount Plus.</p>
